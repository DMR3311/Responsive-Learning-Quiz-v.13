# Google Apps Script Deployment Diagnostic

## Current Status

Your Google Apps Script deployment is redirecting to Google Drive error pages. This means the deployment is not correctly pointing to your updated code.

## How to Check What's Deployed

### Step 1: View Deployments

1. Go to your Apps Script editor
2. Click **Deploy** → **Manage deployments**
3. You should see a list of all deployments

### Step 2: Check Active Deployment

Look at the deployment with URL ending in `...3InpD6ZPmvzQi6O3pAcSfPzHpJ3Q/exec`

Check:
- **Version**: What version is it using? (Should say "@1", "@2", etc.)
- **Status**: Is it "Active"?
- **Last modified**: When was it last updated?

### Step 3: View Execution Log

1. In Apps Script editor, click **Executions** (clock icon on left sidebar)
2. Look for recent executions
3. Click on any failed executions to see the error

This will show you EXACTLY what code is running and what errors occur.

## How to Properly Update the Deployment

### Option A: Update Existing Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Copy new code**: Get all code from `GOOGLE-APPS-SCRIPT-SIMPLE.gs`
2. **Paste in editor**: Replace ALL code in the Apps Script editor
3. **Save**: Click save icon (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)
4. **Deploy → Manage deployments**
5. Click the **pencil/edit icon** next to your current deployment
6. **Version**: Click dropdown and select **"New version"**
7. **Description**: Type "Fixed CORS handling" (or anything)
8. Click **Deploy**
9. Wait for "Deployment updated successfully"

The URL stays the same, but the code updates.

### Option B: Create Fresh Deployment

If Option A doesn't work:

1. **Deploy → Manage deployments**
2. **Archive** all old deployments (click trash icon)
3. Close the dialog
4. **Deploy → New deployment**
5. Click gear icon → Select **Web app**
6. Configure:
   - Description: "Quiz v4"
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
7. Click **Deploy**
8. Copy the **NEW URL**
9. Update `.env` with the new URL

## Quick Test

After deploying, immediately test in your browser:

### Test 1: GET Request

Open this URL in your browser:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwP8QX8slL8sLsL34GAE5ceQB7zNlAFFVmfKRl3InpD6ZPmvzQi6O3pAcSfPzHpJ3Q/exec
```

**Expected**: You should see plain text: `OK - Script is running`

**If you see**: Google Drive error page, the deployment is still wrong.

### Test 2: Form POST

Open browser console (F12), paste and run:

```javascript
fetch('https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwP8QX8slL8sLsL34GAE5ceQB7zNlAFFVmfKRl3InpD6ZPmvzQi6O3pAcSfPzHpJ3Q/exec', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
  body: 'name=Browser Test&email=test@test.com&results_json=' + encodeURIComponent('{"version":"v1.0","score":"5/10"}')
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(d => console.log('Result:', d))
.catch(e => console.error('Error:', e));
```

**Expected**: Console shows: `Result: {ok: true, message: "Data saved successfully"}`

**If you see**: Network error or Google Drive page, deployment still wrong.

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Just saving the code
Saving doesn't update the deployment. You must explicitly deploy.

### ❌ Running test function only
The `testSubmission()` function works differently than web requests. Just because the test works doesn't mean the web deployment works.

### ❌ Not creating new version
If you edit a deployment, you MUST select "New version" from the dropdown.

### ❌ Wrong deployment is active
If you have multiple deployments, make sure you're updating the RIGHT one.

## Still Not Working?

Share the output from:
1. What do you see in **Deploy → Manage deployments**? (version number, when updated)
2. What shows in **Executions** log when you try to submit?
3. What happens when you open the GET test URL in browser?
