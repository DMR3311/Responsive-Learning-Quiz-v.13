## How It Works

When a user completes a quiz, the application will automatically:

1. Format the quiz results (score, timing, domain performance, etc.)
2. Send the data to your Google Form using the entry IDs above
3. Google Forms will automatically add a new row to your connected spreadsheet
4. You can view all quiz results in real-time in your Google Sheet

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. Complete a quiz in the application
2. Check your Google Form's responses (or connected spreadsheet)
3. You should see a new entry with all the quiz data

## Configuration Location

The entry IDs are configured in: `src/utils/googleSheets.js` (lines 50-60)
